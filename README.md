# Design-Implementation-of-Bus-Inversion-Coding-system-for-minimizing-switched-capacitance
##ðŸ“Œ Theme
Minimizing switched capacitance during digital communication to reduce dynamic power consumption.

##ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a Bus Inversion (BI) Coding System designed to reduce the number of bit transitions on a communication bus. By intelligently encoding data using the previous state, this technique minimizes switched capacitance, leading to reduced dynamic power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI) in both on-chip and off-chip communication.The system supports both encoding and decoding operations, controlled via a select line, and operates synchronously with a clock signal.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Implement a bus encoding mechanism to reduce bit transitions.
2. Use a select line to switch between encoding and decoding modes.
3. Design a synchronous system with clock-driven input and output.
4. Provide a Verilog-based modular design suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementation.
